# DrawingBot

The Drawing Bot // R.3 Studio  is a project of IAAC, Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia developed at the Master in Robotics and Advanced Construction in 2020/21 by:

Students: Helena Homsi, Juan E. Ojeda, Aslinur Taskin

Faculty: Alexandre Dubor, Aldo Sollazzo

Faculty Assistant: Antoine Jaunard, Ashkan Foroughi, Soroush Garivani

## Getting Started 
This repository will consist of several files each in their respective folders. The idea is to share all current working files in order to expand on the idea of designing and drawing with robots. We will be using a **Turtlebot 3 with a Raspberry Pi 3** containing **Ros Kinetic** as well as a computer running **Ubuntu 16.04**. All necessary files are located in this github and will be explained in the following steps. For the general set up we followed the following website, but our files that are in this github contain more than what is offered in the setup link: https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/sbc_setup/

## Requirements
### For the Turtlebot 3: 
1. 32GB Micro SD Card
2. Raspberry Pi 3 (should already come with the Turtlebot 3 package)
* Download and upload the image file in the folder titled **_Turtlebot3 Image File_** onto a 32GB micro sd card to put into a Raspberry Pi 3 (this image file is the one we worked with)
* Additionally, a clean version of the image file could be found in the following website https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/sbc_setup/#sbc-setup 


### For Ubuntu 16.04:
* Download and upload the disk image file in the folder titled **_Ubuntu 16.04_** onto a USB 
* If you prefer to use a clean disk image, you can download the disk image titled **_Ubuntu16.04_Clean_** and follow the instructions on this link in order to complete the rest of the set up: https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/#pc-setup 

We installed Ubuntu 16.04 on a bootable external hard drive, and we used a 64GB USB as the external hard drive. The following link is how we set up a USB for it to be bootable: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyfqwCFwQ3w&t=428s

Note: If you are using a mac, even if you are using windows via bootcamp, you will have to prepare the USB differently to be able to use it to boot from a mac hardware.
